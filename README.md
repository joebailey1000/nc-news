# Joey's NC News

Welcome to Joey's NC News! This app is a live message board using a server built by me.Log in at the top right corner and feel free to have a look around as any of the pre-seeded users. You can post and delete comments, view articles and vote on anything.

Link to deployed site: https://nc-news-joebailey1000.netlify.app/

The server is also live, but may take a few seconds to spin up when the site is first loaded.
